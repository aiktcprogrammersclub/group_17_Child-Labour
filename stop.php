<h3>AS A CONSUMER </h3>
<p>
As a consumer you have a powerful voice. Companies do not want to be associated with child labour and are sensitive to bad publicity and consumer campaigns. Many products have been made with child labour. This is not always easy to trace, but we can try to pay as much attention as possible and take this into consideration when buying articles.
</p>
 <h3>AS A COMPANY OR ORGANISATION</h3>
<p>International trade and investments afford opportunities and open new markets. When doing business across borders it is important for companies to do so in a socially responsible manner: with care for people, resources, the environment and the immediate surroundings. As an entrepreneur you can play a positive and visible role and take responsibility by making a lasting influence and doing what you can, for instance towards the elimination of child labour.
</p>
<h3>AS A POLITICIAN </h3>
<p>
Where best to start the fight against child labour? With employers who allow children to work in their factories? With importers who buy the products from the factories as cheaply as possible? With shopkeepers and customers who are not critical about what they buy?
</p>
<h3>AT SCHOOL </h3>
<p>
Education in the Netherlands can play an important role in fighting child labour. Awareness can be raised and action taken at every level of the education system. Many teachers, pupils and other colleagues in education have shown that this is not difficult. Their success stories and tips have been compiled in the special publication "Letâ€™s all go to school", along with other suggestions for activities at school and in class.

		The second time we met Gudia was after 6 months of our first meeting. 
  This time was different, we were disturbingly shocked to see the adverse changes that had engulfed and forced her into such an ill fate. 
  Those little eyes that once twinkled with the gleam of becoming a doctor, sparkled no more. 
  She now worked as a servant, cleaning dishes and doing chores in a rich mans house, only to earn a square meal for her struggling family.
</p>

<p>We asked Gudiya... "Where is that aspiring Doctor that We had seen 6 months back?"
She replied "She is dead..." Just like my father!"</p>

<p><b>"LIKE GUDIYA 40 MILLION CHILDREN ARE STILL BEING EXPLOITED MOSTLY NOT BY CHOICE BUT DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES"</b>
</p>
<p>
*This is a translated version of the actual quote that Gudiya had written in her notebook exactly two days after she was forced to leave her school. 
Gudiya has been enrolled in one of our School's situated at Madanpur Khadar and we are am sure if you stand by her one day she will definitely achieve her dream of becoming a doctor!
</p>

<p>
This is no fiction. 
 Its the true story of a 9 year old deprived girl child, Gudiya.
 According to her friends and teachers, she was extremely good in studies at the time she was in class III.
 Unfortunately she can't go to school anymore, because she has to earn money for he family after the sudden demise of her father,
 who was the sole bread earner of the family. She had to choose between her books and starvation. 
 </p>
 <p>
 The choice was obvious she decided to help her mother by earning a livelihood to support her family and the education of her younger brother. 
 This is an appeal to you on behalf of Gudiya and many others just like her, who are victim of the indigence of their families.
 They are forced to dropout of school because their family can't afford the cost of their studies.
 With your contribution we will make sure, that all children have an equal opportunity to education and that no girl has drop out of school.
